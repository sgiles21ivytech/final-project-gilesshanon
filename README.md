This project is a mock ordering system prototype developed to explore improvements to the current online ordering experience of Latte Lounge, a real café based in St. Louis. Through research into the business’s existing workflow and digital presence, this project identifies and addresses a key area of opportunity: simplifying and streamlining the customer ordering process.

The application is built using Python with Flask and Jinja2 templates, and it mimics a full web-based ordering flow from browsing the menu to order confirmation. Key features include:

    A categorized, user-friendly menu with clear item organization

    A persistent cart system that updates dynamically as items are added

    A total cost calculator displayed in real-time during checkout

    A clean confirmation page showing a full order summary

    Simple, navigable HTML and CSS styling to enhance user experience

The menu items and pricing structure are modeled directly after the real café’s offerings, giving this mockup a grounded, real-world context. The goal is to demonstrate what a more functional, intuitive web ordering system could look like if implemented for Latte Lounge’s actual website.

This project serves as a conceptual redesign and proof of concept — not an official product or affiliation with the business — with a focus on enhancing usability, reducing friction during checkout, and improving the overall digital ordering experience for local coffee shop customers.
